# AI Care Navigator

AI-powered care coordination & prior-authorization assistant for healthcare teams.
AI Care Navigator is a full-stack, cloud-deployed backend system designed to help healthcare analysts and care managers understand member data, care gaps, and authorization decisions using AI-assisted reasoning, structured APIs, and modern system architecture.
This project demonstrates AI-assisted system design, tool-based reasoning (MCP), backend engineering, integration testing, CI/CD, and cloud deployment.

## Problem Description

Healthcare teams (case managers, analysts, care coordinators) often struggle with:

Understanding member risk and care gaps

Interpreting authorization decisions (approved vs denied)

Navigating complex medical policies

Writing clear summaries and next-step recommendations

### This leads to:

Manual effort

Delays in care

Errors and inconsistent decisions

Poor member experience

## Goal

Build an AI-powered system that:

Exposes clean APIs for member data

Explains authorization outcomes

Summarizes care gaps

Demonstrates modern AI orchestration using tools (MCP + agents)

## High-Level System Overview

User Flow

Search for a member

View demographics, care gaps, and authorizations

Ask AI questions such as:

“Why was this authorization denied?”

“What actions should I take next?”

System Responsibilities

Backend provides structured data and AI endpoints

AI reasoning is handled via tool-based orchestration (MCP)

Integration tests validate real workflows

CI/CD automates validation

Backend is deployed to the cloud

```
## Frontend

### Purpose:

The frontend provides an intuitive interface for healthcare users to interact with member data and AI explanations.

Frontend was created using Lovable.

#### Tech:

React / TypeScript

Centralized API client

Component-based structure

#### AI Tooling:

Lovable was used to assist with:

UI scaffolding

Component layout ideas

Frontend structure suggestions

The frontend demonstrates how a real care management UI would consume the backend APIs.

## Backend (FastAPI)

### Overview

The backend is a production-oriented FastAPI application that exposes:

Member search & profiles

Care gaps

Authorizations

AI-powered explanations

Persistent AI audit logs

It is designed to support AI agents and MCP-based orchestration.

Used ChatGpt to assist with backend development.

### Tech Stack:

FastAPI

Pydantic

SQLAlchemy (async)

PostgreSQL

Uvicorn

Python 3.12

Docker

├── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```
## API Endpoints

#### Health

GET /health

#### Members

GET /members

GET /members/{id}

GET /members/{id}/care-gaps

GET /members/{id}/authorizations

#### AI

POST /ai/query

#### Example Request:
```
{
  "query": "Why was this authorization denied?",
  "context": {
    "memberId": "MBR-001",
    "authorizationId": "AUTH-002"
  }
}
```

#### Automatically generated via FastAPI:

Swagger UI: /docs

ReDoc: /redoc

## Database Layer

### Tables:

members

care_gaps

authorizations

ai_interactions (audit trail)

### Databases

SQLite (local development)

PostgreSQL (Docker & production)

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is used to:

Expose backend capabilities as typed AI tools

Decouple AI reasoning from business logic

Enable multi-step workflows (search → retrieve → explain)

### MCP Tools

search_members

get_member

get_member_care_gaps

get_member_authorizations

query_ai

### MCP Workflow

User asks a question

AI agent decides which tools to call

MCP server executes backend actions

Agent synthesizes final response

## AI Agent

#### Purpose:

A standalone AI agent consumes MCP tools to perform reasoning workflows.

#### Agent Capabilities

Discovers MCP tools dynamically

Calls backend tools via MCP

Orchestrates multi-step reasoning

Persists AI interactions

#### Example Workflow

Search member

Fetch authorizations

Identify denial

Ask AI to explain

Store response in DB

The agent is for development, experimentation, and demonstration, not production deployment.

### AI-Assisted Development (Transparency)

This project was explicitly built with AI assistance:

ChatGPT was used to:

Design architecture

Debug Docker, MCP, and agent integration

Create tests and CI workflows

Improve documentation

Lovable was used to assist frontend design and structure

This aligns with modern AI-assisted engineering workflows and is intentionally documented.

### MCP Server
cd mcp

python server.py

### Agent
cd agent

python agent.py

## Testing Strategy

Philosophy

Tests validate real system behavior (no mocks).

#### Tests cover:

API correctness

Database interaction

AI reasoning output

Persistence of AI queries

## How to Run This Project

### Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Oliverajovanovic90/AI-Care-Navigator.git

cd AI-Care-Navigator

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

Docker (v20+)

Docker Compose

Git

curl (for test scripts)

No local Python installation is required if using Docker.

### Start the System (Backend + Database)

From the project root:

cd infra

docker compose up -d


This will start:

FastAPI backend (http://localhost:8000)

PostgreSQL database

### Verify backend health:

curl http://localhost:8000/health


Expected response:

{ "status": "ok" }

### View API Documentation

Open your browser:

Swagger UI

 http://localhost:8000/docs

ReDoc

 http://localhost:8000/redoc

These pages show the full OpenAPI contract used by the frontend and AI systems.

#### Run Integration Tests (Required for Grading)

From the project root:

./tests/test_members.sh

./tests/test_ai.sh

These tests validate:

Member search and profiles

Care gaps and authorizations

AI explanations

Database persistence

End-to-end workflows (no mocks)

### Expected output ends with:
